# TechDevNews

Welcome to TechDevNews! This CLI gem will collect twenty latest news articles from a website.  Users can then select a specific news article to read a short synopsis of the article, and if the article is interesting, then the users can opt to open up the rest of the article in their web browser to read the rest of the article.  

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tech_dev_news'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tech_dev_news

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
